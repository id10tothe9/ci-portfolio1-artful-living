# Artful Living
The Artful Living website serves as the primary online hub for a talented artist. Through this portal, visitors are introduced to an exquisite collection of handcrafted products made using resin painting techniques.

The website showcases both available and past creations, providing customers with inspiration to request either an existing item or a unique, personalised creation from the artist. Contacting the artist is made easy through a contact form. The website design embodies the essence and ethos of Artful Living, showcasing artworks in a simple yet delightful manner for prospective buyers to peruse and acquire pieces that resonate with them.
